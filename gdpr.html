        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 28, 2025</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Our Commitment to GDPR:</strong> ApplyBoost is fully committed to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This page explains how we protect the rights of individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, and Switzerland.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. What is GDPR?</h2>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law that came into effect on May 25, 2018. It provides individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA) with enhanced rights over their personal data and imposes strict obligations on organizations that process such data.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Our GDPR Compliance Principles</h2>
        <p>ApplyBoost adheres to the following GDPR principles when processing personal data:</p>
        
        <h3>2.1 Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency</h3>
        <p>We process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. We clearly communicate what data we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it.</p>
        
        <h3>2.2 Purpose Limitation</h3>
        <p>We collect personal data for specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes and do not process it in ways incompatible with those purposes.</p>
        
        <h3>2.3 Data Minimization</h3>
        <p>We only collect personal data that is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for our stated purposes.</p>
        
        <h3>2.4 Accuracy</h3>
        <p>We take reasonable steps to ensure personal data is accurate and kept up to date. You can update your information at any time through your account settings.</p>
        
        <h3>2.5 Storage Limitation</h3>
        <p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, unless a longer retention period is required by law.</p>
        
        <h3>2.6 Integrity and Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data.</p>
        
        <h3>2.7 Accountability</h3>
        <p>We are responsible for and can demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
        <p>We process your personal data under the following legal bases:</p>
